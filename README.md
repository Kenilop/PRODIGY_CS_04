This code employments the win32api, win32con, win32gui, and win32process modules to connected with the Windows API. It sets up logging to a record named keylog.txt and logs keystrokes to that record. The OnKeyboardEvent work is called at whatever point a keystroke is identified, and it logs the key to the record.

To run this code, spare it to a record named kelogger.py and run it with Python. The program will begin logging keystrokes until hindered by squeezing Ctrl+C.

If you don't mind note that this code is for instructive purposes as it were. Logging keystrokes on a framework without unequivocal consent could be a infringement of protection and may be unlawful in a few purviews. It is vital to utilize this code dependably and morally.Â
